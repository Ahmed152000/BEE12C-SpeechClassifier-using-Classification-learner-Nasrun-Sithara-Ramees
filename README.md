Abstract:
Audio Classification is performed using Machine Learning that involves identifying various audio signals into different classes or categories. The goal of audio classification is to enable machines to automatically recognize and distinguish between different types of audios, including music, speech, and environmental sounds. The model we have created focuses on speech recognition of an audio signal that uses the Classification Learner application in MATLAB.
